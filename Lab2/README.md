# Exercise 1

**Run the sample test cases created from the tutorial, and report the results in the table below.**

**For each test case, specify the Expected Results (from the test case), the Actual Results (from the execution) and a Verdict (Pass if Actual Result and Expected Results match, Fail if Actual Result and Expected Results do not match and Inconclusive for cases where a determination can not be made).**

First, we need to run the app. To do so, all we need to do is run the command

`java -jar  user-registration-app-0.1.0.jar`

Here are the results for the test cases created from the tutorial :

| Test case | Expected Results              | Actual Results                                                                                                   | Verdict (Pass, Fail, Inconclusive) |

This is the third laboratory for the course SEG3103.


## Exercise 1

**Derive a test suite for 100% X coverage for class Date: statement coverage, branch coverage, condition coverage, and condition/branch coverage.**

First, we ran Jacoco against the existing Date tests and observed the coverage.

![Date.java Initial Code Coverage](assets/initial-coverage.png)

To do this we used the following series of commands.  

Compiled the application: `javac -encoding UTF-8 --source-path src -d dist src/*.java`  

Compiled the tests: `javac -encoding UTF-8 --source-path test -d dist -cp dist:lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1.jar test/*.java`  

Ran the agent: `java -javaagent:lib/jacocoagent.jar -jar lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1.jar --class-path dist --scan-class-path`  

Generated report: `java -jar lib/jacococli.jar report jacoco.exec --classfiles dist --sourcefiles src --html report`  

Opened the report: `open ./report/index.html `  


Then we added additional tests in the DateTest.java file to achieve better coverage. The following image shows the results we obtained.

![Date.java Improved Code Coverage](assets/coverage.png)

First, we achieved 100% coverage for the method isThirtyDayMonth(). The initial test suite did not include a test case for the month of September (month 9), which is a thirty day month. We added the following test case:
```java
@Test
void nextDate_month9() {
    Date today = new Date(1901, 9, 1);
    Date expectedTomorrow = new Date(1901, 9, 2);
    assertEquals(expectedTomorrow, today.nextDate());
}
```

Next, we achieved 100% coverage for the method isLeapYear(). The initial test suite did not include a test where the year was a century year divisible by 400. So, we added the following test case, where the year is 2000 (which is a century year divisible by 400):
```java
@Test 
void nextDate_leapYear(){
    Date today = new Date(2000, 1, 1);
    Date expectedTomorrow = new Date(2000, 1, 2);
    assertEquals(expectedTomorrow, today.nextDate());
}
```

Then, we improved the coverage for the method isEndOfMonth(). The initial test suite did not include a test where the year is not a leap year, the month is February (2), and the day is the 28th. As well, it did not include a test where the year is a leap year, the month is February (2), and the day is the 28th. We added these tests, as shown here:
```java
@Test
void nextDate_endOfMonth(){
    Date today = new Date(2021, 2, 28);
    Date expectedTomorrow = new Date(2021, 3, 1);
    assertEquals(expectedTomorrow, today.nextDate());
}

@Test
void nextDate_endOfMonth2(){
    Date today = new Date(2020, 2, 28);
    Date expectedTomorrow = new Date(2020, 2, 29);
    assertEquals(expectedTomorrow, today.nextDate());
}
```
However, it is not possible to obtain 100% coverage. It is impossible for the month of February to have 29 days if it is not a leap year, so the branch with this condition cannot be covered.

Furthermore, we achieved 100% coverage for the equals(Object) method. The original test suite did not include tests where a date was compared to an object. The equals() method should return False in this case. We also had to add tests to compare dates where the year, month, and day are different between the two dates (nextDate_equals2()), where the months and days are different between the two dates (nextDate_equals3()), and where the days are different between the two days (nextDate_equals4()). These tests are shown here:
```java
@Test
void nextDate_equals(){
    Object obj = new Object();
    Date date = new Date(2021,5,27);
    assertFalse(date.equals(obj));
}

@Test
void nextDate_equals2(){
    Date date = new Date(2021,5,27);
    Date date2 = new Date(2020,4,26);
    assertFalse(date.equals(date2));
}

@Test
void nextDate_equals3(){
    Date date = new Date(2021,5,27);
    Date date2 = new Date(2021,4,26);
    assertFalse(date.equals(date2));
}

@Test
void nextDate_equals4(){
    Date date = new Date(2021,5,27);
    Date date2 = new Date(2021,5,26);
    assertFalse(date.equals(date2));
}
 ```

Next, we achieved full coverage for the toString() method by adding the following test:
```java
@Test
void nextDate_toString(){
    Date date = new Date(2021,5,27);
    assertEquals("2021/May/27",date.toString());
}
```

Lastly, we achieved full coverage for the setDay(int) method by adding the following tests which test for the cases where the day is greater than 31, where the day is greater than 30 for a 30-day month, and where the day is greater than 29 in February in a leap year:
```java
@Test
void nextDate_invalid_setDay() {
    assertThrows(
      IllegalArgumentException.class,
      () -> new Date(1975, 6, 32)
    );
}

@Test
void nextDate_invalid_setDay2() {
    assertThrows(
      IllegalArgumentException.class,
      () -> new Date(2010, 4, 31)
    );
}

@Test
void nextDate_invalid_setDay3() {
    assertThrows(
      IllegalArgumentException.class,
      () -> new Date(2020, 2, 30)
    );
}
```

Another reason we cannot achieve 100% coverage for Date.java is that in the setMonth() method, the month cannot be less than 1 and greater than 12 at the same time. Therefore, only 3 out of 4 branches can be covered by the test cases.

## Exercise 2


**Refactor Date.java. Run coverage after refactoring.**

To refactor Date.java, we decided to make small changes to the methods **setDay()** and **isThirtyDayMonth**. 

Here is the setDay() method before we made any changes : 

![setDateBefore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56052670/120373957-f0041c80-c2e6-11eb-88d6-83fce6131a4d.png)

and here is the setDay() method after we refactored it : 

![newSetDate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56052670/120374030-0611dd00-c2e7-11eb-8880-2b284f3f34f1.PNG)


As for the isThirtyDayMonth method, here is the method before we made any changes : 

![isThirtyDayMonthBefore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56052670/120374110-1f1a8e00-c2e7-11eb-87a0-26cbe2c59c4a.PNG)

and here is the isThirtyDayMonth method after we refactored it :

![isThirtyDayMonthAfter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56052670/120374117-22ae1500-c2e7-11eb-8ba8-2faad7199644.PNG)

One thing to note is that we are not using the new tests that we wrote for the first exercice when running the coverage. This way, we can better see if the refactoring we did actually improved the coverage or not.

Here is the report that was generated after the refactorisation of both methods : 

![reportAfterRefactor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56052670/120374149-30fc3100-c2e7-11eb-965a-043955daa756.PNG)

Compared to the [initial code coverage generated](assets/initial-coverage.png), we can see that the coverage for both refactored method improved. setDay() went from 64% instruction coverage to 80% and isThirtyDayMonth went from 87% branch coverage to 100% branch coverage. 

The instruction coverage for setDay improved due to having less if statement to test. Initially, this method had 5 if statements and after our refactorisation, it only has 3. This is what makes the instruction coverage change for the better.

As for isThirtyDayMonth, the branch coverage improved due to having less possibilites inside the if statement. Before we made changes, the method had 4 OR statements. Now, it only has to check if the month is part of a list of month that have 30 days. This makes the code a bit cleaner and reduces the number of branches to check while testing.
